            <li>1/4 cup lime juice</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, smashed</li>
            <li>2 tsps white sugar</li>
            <li>1 tsp fish sauce (optional)</li>
            <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 pound beef steak, sliced 1/4in. thick</li>
            <li>2 tbsps vegetable oil, divided, or as needed</li>
            <li>4 potatoes, cut into wedges (optional)</li>
            <li>1 large onion, cut into rings</li>
            <li>1/8 cup water (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine soy sauce, lime juice, garlic, sugar, fish sauce, and pepper in a bowl. Taste and adjust to your liking. Add sliced beef, making sure it is coated evenly. Marinate for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok or pan over medium-high heat. Fry potatoes in the hot oil until the edges turn golden brown, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a plate.</li>
            <li>Heat remaining oil in the same pan over medium-high heat and fry onions until edges turn brown, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer to the same plate.</li>
            <li>Heat the same pan over medium-high heat. Reserve marinade and fry beef in batches, adding more vegetable oil if necessary, until browned and no longer pink in the centers, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to the plate and continue with remaining beef.</li>
            <li>Pour reserved marinade into the pan with water to deglaze, scraping up browned bits from the bottom of the pan using a wooden spoon. Taste and adjust seasonings. Return beef back to the pan with some onion, leaving remaining onion for garnish; reduce heat and let simmer until sauce has thickened, 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Slide beef and sauce onto a serving plate. Garnish with remaining onion. Place potatoes on the side and serve.</li>
        </ol>
